    content: `I just finished a ~7 hour crash course in javascript on scrimba. I had trouble with the final practice challenges, as some things in my brain haven't clicked yet. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how certain things like arrays, for loops and parameters all fit in with each other. I'm confident with things like buttons, basic css text & color formatting, certain aspects of functions, variables and setting up for loops, but even then I'd still need a quick peek at the solutions. It feels like my brain is trying to comprehend certain things but can't quite yet. Nonetheless, I feel pretty good about it and I'm starting the ~80 hour frontend developer path on scrimba today. Wish me luck :)`,

    content: `I'm about a quarter of the way through the 80 hour frontend path on scrimba. A friend who has been my coding mentor contacted me yesterday and recommended I start The Odin Project. Reading through the introductory section, I felt like scrimba may be a bit on the "hand-holdy" side, and although I like it, TOP seems like it doesn't hold your hand as much and forces you to figure things out on your own a bit more. The introductory section spends a lot of time giving you a bird's eye view of the coding journey, and common misconceptions. I decided I'm going to write down how I feel about my coding knowledge so far -

    I can do basic html & css, and feel pretty good about them. I know how to do buttons, styling, spacing, classes and IDs, and basic "getdocumentbyID" stuff in javascript. 
    
    I did some "for" loops and arrays in scrimba, but I need to brush up on them.
    
    Not sure how to use git or GitHub. No idea :)
    
    I'm getting better at navigating VS code (creating the .html / .css pages & "running" them in the browser).
    
    Still need practice with terminal and learning CS basics. I understand that data exists on servers and my friend's basic flowchart of how the internet works, but that's about it.
    
    Besides basic html, basic css, and a microscopic fraction of javascript, I know nothing about other languages and still have no idea what I'm doing :)`,

    content: `I just finished the last 2 exercises, of the first 7 javascript exercises in TOP fundamentals part 4, and let me just say...what a massive hit of dopamine I got finishing those lol. Some of these exercises were so difficult for me to wrap my head around, especially some of the string ones. They took me days, and I was losing some confidence in my abilities and my intelligence. I took a step back from my unrealistic expectations of finishing all of these exercises in a day with ease, and worked on them a day at a time. I think sumAll took me at least a couple days to complete, but I DID IT. Then today I completed the last 2, and they weren't that hard for me! It's like all the thinking and analyzing with loops, arrays, conditionals, and the syntax that goes along with those for the previous exercises finally caused them to really start clicking in my brain. If I had do redo them, I would definitely need to google everything again, but I would be way more confident this time. God damn.`,

    content: `I'm working through the code smith CSX course challenges before I schedule a technical interview for that. I'm going to schedule a technical interview tomorrow for fullstack, and I already have a non-tech interview for hack reactor in the beginning of May. These are the 3 best schools on my list, so I'm trying to focus on getting into these ones first. I'm putting coding projects on hiatus and really trying to hone my algorithm and function skills, in addition to just learning more about javascript. I still need to learn recursion, promises, and some other stuff, and right now I'm deep into callback functions. For some of these CSX challenges, I can do them in less than 5 minutes. Other ones are way tougher, and still confusing to me even after checking the solutions. Anyway, back to work. Hopefully by my next entry I understand callback functions a little better :)`,

    content: `SUP. I've got 13 out of 49 specs passing so far on this fullstack checkpoint ;) I just spent like an hour (at least) on figuring out how to change snake case to title case ('hello_world' to 'Hello World). My head hurts. BUT I figured out how to use the other parameters that the map method accepts. I always just ignored them, but I looked it up and saw how it has the index parameter, which was super useful. I know I maybe spent a bit too much time on that, but I still have a couple days left, and god damn do I feel good about figuring that out.`,
